<h1>Foodie App - React Native</h1>

<h2>Project Guidelines</h2><br>
<p>The aim for this project is to build a simple mobile app to search for different cuisine in Toronto app using Yelp API. User stories:</p><br>
<ul>
<li>I want to be able to search for any food type and and get a list of restaurants in Toronto </li>
<li>I want to see ratings star for each restaurant and also count for reviews </li>
<li>I want to be able to see the results categorized based on price </li>
<li>I want to be able to see details for each result with more pictures, address and phone number</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Approach</h2>
<p>For this app, I used React Native with expo starter package; for React part, I used hooks instead of classes and Redux for state management.</p><br>
